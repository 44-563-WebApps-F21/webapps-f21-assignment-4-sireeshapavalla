            <p class=stage-direction>Enter COUNT ROUVALOFF, MARQUIS DE POIVRARD, and  BARON RAFF</p>
            <h6 class="name BARON RAFF. "> BARON RAFF</h6>
            <p class="speech">If they had you would have missed a charming dance.
            </p>

            <p class=stage-direction>PRINCE PAUL</p>

            <p class="speech"> And[2] an excellent supper. Gringoire really excelled
                himself in his salad. </p>

            <p class="stage-direction">BARON RAFF</p>

            <p class="speech">A cook and a diplomatist! an excellent parallel.</p>
            

            <p class="stage-direction">PRINCE PAUL</p>

            <p class="speech">(_bowing_). Que voulez vous? I manage your father's
                business..</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">CZAR</p>

            <p class="speech">You are right. If he really loved the people, he could not be my
                son.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">PRINCE PAUL</p>

            <p class="speech">If he lived with the people for a fortnight, their bad
                dinners would soon cure him of his democracy.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">CZARE.</p>

            <p class="speech">The prisons of Russia are too full already, Sire</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">PRINCE PAUL</p>

            <p class="speech">From the Chief of the Police at Archangel, Sire.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">CZAR</p>

            <p class="speech">I never trusted the people of Archangel. It's a nest of Nihilists
                and conspirators. Take away their saints;</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">PRINCE PAUL</p>

            <p class="speech">It would be a very disappointing letter, Sire, if there
                wasn't. (_Takes letter himself, and reads it._)
                </p>

            <h6 class="name PRINCE PETRO.">PRINCE PETRO.</h6>
            <p class="speech">It must be some sad news. I know
                that smile too well.</p>

            <p class="speech">(_to the CZAR_). Start to-night, Sire? (_PRINCE PAUL

            <h6 class="name COUNT R">COUNT R</h6>
            <p class="speech">(_to PRINCE PETROVITCH_). I should be more alarmed for myself.</p>

            <h6 class="name PRINCE PETRO">PRINCE PETRO</h6>
            <p class="speech"> Because he leads such an idle life.</p>

            <h6 class="name VERA"> VERA</h6>
            <p class="speech">How can you say such a thing?  Why, he rides in the Row
                at ten o’clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week,
                changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night
                of the season.  You don’t call that leading an idle life, do you?</p>

            <p class="speech">[Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes.]
                You are a very charming young lady!</p>

                <p class="speech">And you are younger and more beautiful than ever.
                    How do you manage it?</p>
    
                <p class="stage-direction">enternace of VERA</p>
    
                <p class="speech">Good evening, Lady Markby!  I hope you have brought
                    Sir John with you?</p>
    
                <p class="stage-direction">Re-enter VERA</p>
    
                <p class="speech">Oh! I have brought a much more charming person than Sir
                    John.  Sir John’s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has
                    become quite unbearable.  Really, now that the House of Commons is trying
                    to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.</p>
